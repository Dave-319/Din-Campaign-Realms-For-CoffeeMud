These files are used for a MUD text adventure game that includes: building & advancing a character, gaining abilities, exploring the world, crafting & acquiring items & property, defeating enemies, solving quests & puzzles, socializing, role play, and more. 

These files are, and should be considered, creative work data files and not software programs.  They are loaded by a separate software program called CoffeeMud similar to how a literary word text document might be loaded and presented by a word processor software program.

Area files (extension .cmare) contain a text world to adventure and explore.  They are highly interactive (at the option of the player) with many scripts included, but also nicely support standard hack-n-slash play as well.
Quest files (extension .quest) orchestrate a specific quest event that is carried out within the world of the area files.
Each can be imported into the CoffeeMud engine through standard CoffeeMud commands and should load ready to play. However, room #0 in each area will mention any tweaks that may be advisable, as well as intended area links to other areas.
